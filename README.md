# BunNativeKit

> Early work in progress. Don't expect anything to work (how you want it to at least).

BunNativeKit (bnk) is a little research project i started to do a bunch of funny "nonsense" and "neat" things to- uh i mean WITH* bun :D

### Essentially a TLDR of BNK would be my funny attempt at working with native code in Bun, but wrapping it up in a nice DX box :D

Give https://bunnativekit.xwx.gg a look for more nonsense (bnk.xwx.gg also works dw <3)
